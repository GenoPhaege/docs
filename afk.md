# How to Not be AFK'd: Deepwater Hooligans Edition!

This guide presents the Alliance AFK policy. It clarifies guidelines for both members and CEOs, explaining reasons behind AFK assignments and the process to regain active status.

## For Members

### Why Was I AFK'd?

BIGAB aims to maintain a clean Discord environment and reduce security risks by proactively assigning AFK roles to inactive members. Being AFK'd doesn't mean you're out of the corp, the alliance, or a target in space. Your membership and in-game standings remain unchanged. You probably were AFK'd due to a lapse in the activity requirements specified below.

**There is a chance, of course, that there was a mistake during an audit and you were given the role in error. Let us know of the mistake and we'll get it fixed for you quickly!**

### AFK Criteria

During audits, leadership uses these criteria to determine AFK assignments:

* No killmails/fleet activity for 60 days on any BIGAB character or in a BIGAB fleet.
* No prior communication to leadership about an extended absence.
* No special circumstances warranting inactivity.

There are some exceptions where inactive individuals may remain with their original roles.
If you're facing challenges like relocation, health concerns, vacations, or any genuine reason causing inactivity, notify your corp's or the alliance's leadership to prevent getting AFK'd.


## For CEOs

### AFK Audit Procedure

Members, their Corporation Directors/CEO, and Alliance Leadership will take the following steps to determine AFK assignment:

* Members should inform corp or alliance leadership about prolonged absences, documented in the Corp Leadership channel.
* Every 30 days, the alliance identifies accounts without a kill in the last 60 days.
* This list is cross-referenced with the Leave of Absence list and other metrics (e.g., Alts, Discord activity).
* The refined list is shared in the Corp Leadership channel.
* CEOs/Directors have five days to engage with the flagged members to understand their inactivity and encourage re-engagement.
* CEOs/Directors can address individual cases in the Corp Leadership channel, allowing list adjustments.
* After five days, those still on the list are assigned AFK roles.

### Returning from AFK

* AFK members retain access to channels like #commerce (for asset sales), #other-games (off-topic), etc.
* To regain active status, members must submit a screenshot of their doctrine ships at the current staging citadel to their CEO/Director.
* This screenshot should capture all ships, adhering to Alliance standards (e.g., main doctrine DPS ships).
* CEOs/Directors share this screenshot in the Corp Leadership channel, facilitating AFK role removal.

### Special Case - Recurrent AFK Assignments

In the rare instance that a member is AFK'd three times over the course of 6 months, Alliance and Corporation leadership will gather to decide the next steps.
Repeated AFK assignments might indicate the member's misalignment with the alliance's culture, or that the member does not enjoy flying with the alliance. The member may not be suited to return from AFK status. That is ok - we want people to enjoy themselves.
In such cases, the AFK status might become permanent, requiring member notification.
