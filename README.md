# Welcome to Deepwater Hooligans!

Welcome to the most crunchwrap supreme mid-scale pvp group.

**Please read this entire document.**  We have done our best to keep it short.

## Culture and Etiquette
In Discord, Teamspeak, or any other communication platform we may use within the game, it is never okay to participate in or perpetuate (yes, even ironically):
* Racism
* Sexism
* Homophobia
* Transphobia

Some common instances of these and other things that might be okay in other places in EVE, but are not okay on BIGAB or SOUND comms:
* Use of 'gay' and similar as a slur 
* Use of 'rape' as a synonym for kill/destroy/etc
* Use of 'retard' and similar
* Use of 'autistic' or similar as a disparaging slur
* Use of "REEEEE" / "autistic screeching" to express frustration (^see above)
* Xenophobia (see: sinophobia)

## Current staging

`Lantorn VI - Moon 4 - Expert Distribution Warehouse` - All subcaps **Deathclones Here**

`Amamake - Finally.` (Keepstar) - Supers go here

## Things you must own

You **must** own at least one of each of of the below.

Some might already be on alliance contract in staging; if they are not, see [Jump freight](#jump-freight) for how to get them shipped in.

Each doctrine has an in-game channel associated with that has the fits for DPS, Logi, and relevant support and is in parentheses after the doctrine name in the below list.

### Ships you must own
* 10MN Tengu (`BIGAB.tengus`)
* 10MN Loki (`BIGAB.lokis`)
* Nightmare (`BIGAB.nightmares`)
* Cerberus (`BIGAB.cerbs`)
* 10MN Legion (`BIGAB.heavyarmor`)
* Tempest Fleet Issue (`BIGAB.heavyarmor`)

These are the line dps ships for our main doctrines.

Logi and other support ships are handout; don't buy personal copies.

You **must** own a dps ship even if you usually fly support.

### Pods you must own
* A Nightmare hardwirings pod (available in the cargo of the Nightmare in the `BIGAB.nightmares` channel)
* Mid-grade Amulet pod (w/ HG-1005). If you can afford a high-grade pod buy one, but be warned there is **no pod SRP**

## Things you should probably own

* Small-gang nano ships
* Sabres/dictors
* Void bombers for alts
* An armor buffer black ops battleship, or a conduitable armor buffer support ship

## Our other doctrines

These doctrines are handout-only, but you must be skilled into at least one ship for them.

* Kikimoras (+ Scalpels, Keres, Hyena)

## Jump freight
Our corporation `Sock Workers` accepts courier contracts.

Contracts are generally run at least once daily.

The reward rate between Jita and Mantenault is 500 ISK/m3.

7 days expiry, 7 days to complete.

**Zero collateral** is strongly preferred.  Sock Workers operations are 100% insured with the full faith and backing of Deepwater Hooligans.

Collateral, like guacamole, is extra.
ðŸ¥‘ If you feel the need to use collateral, add 2.5% to the above rate -- and be prepared to wait longer, as JF pilots may give priority to uncollateralized contracts.


## Special interest groups
### Open to anyone
These groups you can self-join via [SEAT](https://deepwaterhooligans.com/).
* **Black Ops** -- pings for blops drops.  Owning an armor buffer blops or other conduitable armor buffer utility ship is recommended.  Owning an active shield blops for solo/smaller gang is nice but not necessary.
* **Deadliest Catch** -- similar to blops but more focused on hunting high-value targets like ratting supers, CRAB dreads.  You need an armor Legion to be useful in this group; fits are in Discord pins once you join.
* **Warlords** -- structure bashing sig to make timers for fights.  Leshak or other heavy armor ship recommended.
* **Pochven** -- krabbing and king of the hill PVP in Pochven.  An average night is 750M in payout and some frags.
### Talk to leadership
* **Capitals** -- capital fits and pings.  JDC5 and cap ownership required.
* **Supers** -- all supers (hyper and tank) go in this channel, discuss with Tim to get access
* **Armor Supers** -- armor supers and titans.  Dedicated fax alt + armor buffer fax ownership required.  Discuss w/ Tim for access
* **Scouts** -- eyes alts, structure hackers, wormhole scanners, cyno alt movers.  You need a vouch from your CEO or from Tim to join
* **Space Chores** -- structure fuellers, other logistics.  You need a vouch from your CEO or from Tim to join
* **Fleet Command** -- if you are interested in FCing, no matter how big or small, reach out to Tim.
* **Waterboards** -- prevent the enemy from using JBs, kill stragglers to fleets, etc.  Talk to Akov Stohs about this.
