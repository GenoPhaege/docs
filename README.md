# Welcome to Deepwater Hooligans!

Welcome to the most crunchwrap supreme mid-scale pvp group.

## Culture and Etiquette
In Discord, Teamspeak, or any other communication platform we may use within the game, it is never okay to participate in or perpetuate (yes, even ironically):
* Racism
* Sexism
* Homophobia
* Transphobia

Some common instances of these and other things that might be okay in other places in EVE, but are not okay on BIGAB or SOUND comms:
* Use of 'gay' and similar as a slur 
* Use of 'rape' as a synonym for kill/destroy/etc
* Use of 'retard' and similar
* Use of 'autistic' or similar as a disparaging slur
* Use of "REEEEE" / "autistic screeching" to express frustration (^see above)
* Xenophobia (see: sinophobia)

## Things you must own

You **must** own at least one of each of of the below.

Some might already be on alliance contract in staging; if they are not, see [Jump freight](#jump-freight) for how to get them shipped in.

Each doctrine has an in-game channel associated with that has the fits for DPS, Logi, and relevant support and is in parentheses after the doctrine name in the below list.

### Ships you must own
* 10MN Tengus (TO-DO make channel and link here)
* 10MN Lokis (BIGAB.lokis)
* Nightmare (BIGAB.nightmares)
* Cerberus (BIGAB.cerbs)
* 10MN Legion (BIGAB.heavyarmor)
* Tempest Fleet Issue (BIGAB.heavyarmor)

These are the line dps ships for our main doctrines.

Logi and other support ships are handout; don't buy personal copies.

You **must** own a dps ship even if you usually fly support.

### Pods you must own
* A Nightmare hardwirings pod (available in the cargo of the Nightmare in the BIGAB.nightmares channel)
* Mid-grade Amulet pod (w/ HG-1005). If you can afford a high-grade pod buy one, but be warned there is no POD SRP

## Things you should probably own

* Small-gang nano ships
* Sabres/dictors
* Void bombers for alts
* An armor buffer black ops battleship, or a conduitable armor buffer support ship

## Our other doctrines

These doctrines are handout-only, but you must be skilled into at least one ship for them.

* Kikimoras
* Ishtars
