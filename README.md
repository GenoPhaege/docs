# Welcome to Deepwater Hooligans!

Welcome to the most crunchwrap supreme mid-scale pvp group.

## Culture and Etiquette
In Discord, Teamspeak, or any other communication platform we may use within the game, it is never okay to participate in or perpetuate (yes, even ironically):
* Racism
* Sexism
* Homophobia
* Transphobia

Some common instances of these and other things that might be okay in other places in EVE, but are not okay on BIGAB or SOUND comms:
* Use of 'gay' and similar as a slur 
* Use of 'rape' as a synonym for kill/destroy/etc
* Use of 'retard' and similar (I know many of us have used this a lot in the past, and we are improving, but let's all make an effort to be better about this.)
* Use of 'autistic' or similar as a disparaging slur
* Use of "REEEEE" / "autistic screeching" to express frustration (^see above)
* Xenophobia (see: sinophobia)

## Things you must own

You **must** own at least one of each of of the below.

Some might already be on alliance contract in staging; if they are not, see [Jump freight](#jump-freight) for how to get them shipped in.

### Ships you must own
* a dps Tengu
* a 10mn dps Loki 
* a Nightmare
* a Cerberus
* a dps Legion
* a Tempest Fleet Issue

These are the line dps ships for our main doctrines.

Logi and other support ships are handout; don't buy personal copies.

You **must** own a dps ship even if you usually fly support.

### Pods you must own
* a Nightmare hardwirings pod
* a mid-grade Amulet pod (w/ HG-1005)

## Things you should probably own

* Small-gang nano ships
* Sabres/dictors
* Void bombers for alts
* An armor buffer black ops battleship, or a conduitable armor buffer support ship

## Our other doctrines

These doctrines are handout-only, but you must be skilled into at least one ship for them.

* Kikimoras
* Ishtars
